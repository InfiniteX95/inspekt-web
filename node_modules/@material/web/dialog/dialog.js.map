There are two types of dialogs: basic and\n * full-screen.\n *\n * @description\n * A dialog is a modal window that appears in front of app content to provide\n * critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app\n * functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed,\n * dismissed, or a required action has been taken.\n *\n * Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.\n * A less disruptive alternative is to use a menu, which provides options\n * without interrupting a userâ€™s experience.\n *\n * On mobile devices only, complex dialogs should be displayed fullscreen.\n *\n * __Example usages:__\n * - Common use cases for basic dialogs include alerts, quick selection, and\n * confirmation.\n * - More complex dialogs may contain actions that require a series of tasks\n * to complete. One example is creating a calendar entry with the event title,\n * date, location, and time.\n */\n@customElement('md-dialog')\nexport class MdDialog extends Dialog {\n  static override styles = [styles];\n}\n"]}
